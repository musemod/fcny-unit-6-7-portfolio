Hi there! I’m a creative technologist and software engineer-in-training with a background in music composition, education, and art. I’m especially excited about combining that creative foundation with tools in web development, open-source AI, and generative design.<br>
</br>
Before getting into code, I spent years composing music for orchestras such as San Francisco Symphony, Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, and Bavarian Radio Symphony—while also teaching at universities, conservatories, and international programs in the U.S. and China. Fun fact: I’m a Juilliard grad and hold a Ph.D. in music composition.<br>
</br>
During the pandemic, I began transforming my music scores and sketches into animated visuals—like <a href="https://youtu.be/EiG1VJJ3q8M?si=tsq2iMVw0KEl-37u" target="_blank"><em>In A Blink of An Eye</em></a> , a piece that ends with a surprise twist. That blend of music and visuals led me to explore Blender’s Python API and open-source AI tools.<br>
</br>
In 2023, I created visuals for <em>Tectonal</em>, a 16-minute piece for ROCO Chamber Orchestra, projected with live orchestra at Houston’s Miller Outdoor Theatre. I collaborated with Emmy Award winners—composer Anthony DiLorenzo and author Lois Stark—and served as the sole concert visuals artist, learning new AI tools on the fly. I love jumping into new tech fast and figuring things out collaboratively.<br>
</br>
In 2024, I spoke at Bowdoin College’s <em>Klavierfest: The Sound of Innovation – How AI and Technology Impact Our Music, Minds, and Machines,</em> where I gave live demos of open source AI tools ComfyUI and Audiocraft Plus. My discussion centered around how to survive the AI revolution by learning how to use open source AI tools locally and offline, while protecting one’s own data, privacy, and original work. I also launched a YouTube channel, AI_MuseGeek, where I teach creatives how to set up <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkArFRBBqyWI-URcEw3zkXo82a82Dklol" target="_blank">their own local AI workstations</a>.<br>
</br>
I’ve also co-created and led projects like <em>No Guarantees</em> — a sold-out music comedy where I secured funding, integrated tech (QR codes, QLab), and directed creative vision. As Artistic Director of YoungArts' 2019 Miami Classical Instrumental program, I recruited and managed a team of creative professionals. We mentored an incredible group of talented teens, encouraging them to perform in bold, unconventional ways.<br>
</br>
Whether I’m coding or composing, I care deeply about clarity, collaboration, and building engaging experiences. Looking to work with someone who bridges engineering, the arts, and education? Let’s build something together.<br>
