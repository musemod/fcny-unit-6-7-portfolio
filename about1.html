Cynthia is a creative technologist, exploring a new genre – the animated music score, such as <a href="https://youtu.be/EiG1VJJ3q8M?si=tsq2iMVw0KEl-37u" target="_blank"><em>In A Blink of An Eye</em></a> – and an explorer of open source generative AI tools. In November 2024, Cynthia presented at Bowdoin College’s <em>Klavierfest: The Sound of Innovation – How AI and Technology Impact Our Music, Minds, and Machines,</em> where she gave live demos of open source AI tools ComfyUI and Audiocraft Plus. Her discussion centered around how to survive the AI revolution by learning how to use open source AI tools locally and offline, while protecting one’s own data, privacy, and original work. <br>
     </br>
As a music score animator, Cynthia’s creative process involves music first and visuals second, taking previously-composed pieces then visually re-imagining them. Her work In A Blink of An Eye, whose music was commissioned by ROCO Chamber Orchestra, brings her orchestral score to life by transforming static music notation into vibrant, colorful animation, culminating into a humorous surprise at the end. The piece celebrates the wondrous, though ephemeral, nature of life. One life, even if short-lived, can impact others in extraordinary ways and is inspired by Chinese-American Iris Chang’s words: “You as ONE individual can change millions of lives. Think big.” <br>
     </br>

In 2022, Cynthia began experimenting with locally-installed generative AI within the limited capabilities of her laptop’s hardware. Among Cynthia’s early AI experiments are her Piano Quartet (2010), based on Edgar Allan Poe’s Ligeia and whose music was co-commissioned by Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival & La Jolla Music Society, as well as Carnival Fever (symphony orchestra, 2014), inspired by The Count of Monte Cristo and whose music was co-commissioned by San Francisco Symphony & New World Symphony. Cynthia used AI to modify thousands of frames, stylizing and changing details such as subjects’ hair and gender.<br>
     </br>

In 2023, Cynthia invested in an AI workstation, whose hardware allowed her to expand her AI palette beyond still images and video modification. She discovered new animation techniques, which can be previewed at a sneak peek into her creative process, while working on a concert visuals project Tectonal (September 2023).  Inspired by acclaimed book The Telling Image, Tectonal is a 16-17 minute video for ROCO. For this project, she collaborated with a dream team of Emmy Award winners — composer Anthony DiLorenzo and author / filmmaker Lois Stark.  <br>
     </br>

As a composer, Cynthia has been commissioned by Orpheus Chamber Orchestra, San Francisco Symphony, New World Symphony, Bavarian Radio Symphony Orchestra (Germany), Orchestra del Teatro Olimpico (Italy), Portland Symphony (Maine), Santa Fe Chamber Music Festival, Tanglewood Music Festival, La Jolla Music Society, New York State Music Teachers Association, Mivos Quartet, and Tokyo String Quartet.<br>
     </br>

A graduate of the accelerated 5-year B.M./M.M. program at Juilliard, Cynthia received her Ph.D. as an Enhanced Chancellor’s Fellow at the Graduate Center, City University of New York. She studied composition with Samuel Adler, Milton Babbitt, David Del Tredici, David Olan, and Larry Thomas Bell, as well as piano with Tatyana Dudochkin, Frank Levy, and Martin Canin. Cynthia also participated in the BMI Musical Theater Workshop.<br>
     </br>

As an educator, Cynthia taught at Baruch College, City University of New York, University of Nevada, Las Vegas, the Southwestern University of Finance and Economics in China, and the New England Conservatory Preparatory School. She was also Master Teacher at National YoungArts Week 2018 and Artistic Director at YoungArts Miami Classical Instrumental 2019 program.<br>
